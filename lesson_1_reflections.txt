How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

I was able to see what changes were made and that there was a typo.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

You can see what changes were made and hopefully shortcut some of those changes to make writing code more efficient.

What do you think are the pros and  ons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs
having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

You can choose when it logically makes sense to save, it is possible to forget to save, or save to big of a change.

Why do you think some version control systems. like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit,
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

The files in a program are linked, so it makes sense to save them together.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log shows the different commits, git diff shows the difference between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

you know that if something breaks, you have an earlier version saved.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

learning to program things.
